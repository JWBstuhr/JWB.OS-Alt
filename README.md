# JWB.OS-Alt

This file differs from the JWB.OS repository in only one way:
All files are changed to no longer be .filename files.
This is due to the fact that OSX systems hide .filename files.

Read the README of the [JWB.OS](https://github.com/JWBstuhr/JWB.OS) for more on the actual JWB.OS.

In the ComputerCraft shell, run

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JWBstuhr/JWB.OS-Alt/main/JWB.OS-WGet-Installer.lua jwbos-installer.lua

to download the Installer for this version.
